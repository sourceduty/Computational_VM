### Computer Machines

The term "machine" is rarely used to describe computer hardware in everyday language, as the word traditionally evokes images of purely mechanical devices like gears, engines, and tools. While technically correct—since a computer is a device performing tasks via energy conversion—the association of "machine" with physical, mechanical systems makes it an uncommon descriptor for computers. However, in specialized contexts like computing, the term gains prominence, such as with "virtual machine" (VM). A virtual machine refers to software that emulates a physical computer, enabling multiple "machines" to operate independently on a single physical device. This terminology highlights the abstraction of computational resources as "machines," even though the concept is far removed from traditional mechanics. Overall, "computer" and "device" dominate in popularity for describing hardware in common usage, with "machine" being reserved for niche or technical discussions.
